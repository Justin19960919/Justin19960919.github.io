As I sitdown to write this first ever blog post on my personal website in LA, I can't help but be amazed at how much has happened for the past 2 years.
It has been humbling to say the least, and if there was one thing I did not know or did not feel as strongly about, is that life can change in an instant.
And that philosophy has stuck with me -  the only thing that doesnt change in life is change.

## Moving
I moved to the States in Sep, 2020. It feels crazy being in the States for already 5 years. I remember like it was yesterday. I was standing on the breezy streets of Seattle, just landed a few hours ago. Didn't have any furniture and needed some cutlery real bad. This was COVID Seattle, and people were walking as fast as they could on the streets, distancing themselves from people. And then boom, I'm in Silicon Valley now. Almost two years in.

## Starting work
This is my first full time job, in the States, as a software engineer. I had previously worked at Wayfair (remote) & Intuit (remote) as interns in 2022. Full-time work is another level of the constant grind, the figuring out where i wanted to go, where my aspirations lied, and what i really wanted. As I'm now 2 years in, and getting hold of the work more, I am starting to really try to start on some new projects that interest me, and fuel my entrepreneur spirit.

## Future
I dont know what the future holds. But i do know, if I don't start managing my life like a company with quarterly goals, then life will pretty much stay stagnant. and that's what my friend told me in May. It's so liberating though isn't it?
