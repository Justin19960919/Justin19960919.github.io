## ❌ Why You Should NOT Sell Naked Puts

1. **Limited upside, but unlimited downside**  
   *This risk asymmetry is dangerous*
2. **Poor for consistent cash flow**
3. **Assigned to buy stock if price drops below strike**  
   *This only works if you have ample cash and want to own the stock anyway*

   *Stick to strong principles → higher chance of long-term profit*

2. **Lose little, win lots**

## 🧮 Option Value Basics

> **Option Value = Intrinsic Value + Time (Extrinsic) Value**

- **Intrinsic Value** = Value if option is In The Money (ITM)
- **Time Value** = Value from time remaining until expiration

### Example:

**Underlying Stock**: $45  
| Strike Price | Intrinsic | Time Value | Total Option Value |
|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| $50 (OTM)    | $0         | $1          | $1                  |
| $40 (ITM)    | $5         | $1.5        | $6.5                |

## 📈 Key Financial Terms

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return
- **Alpha**: Performance relative to benchmark
- **Beta**: Stock's volatility relative to market

## 🧠 Option Greeks (Quick Guide)

| Greek | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Delta** | Price sensitivity of the option to the underlying asset. Also interpreted as the probability of being ITM. <br> - Call: 0 → 1 <br> - Put: 0 → -1 |
| **Gamma** | Rate of change of Delta (how fast Delta moves as stock price changes) |
| **Theta** | Time decay. Always negative. Highest when ATM. |
| **Implied Volatility (IV)** | Market’s expectation of volatility. Higher before events (e.g. earnings). <br> Choose IV between **30% – 70%** |

---

## 🔍 Choosing the Underlying Stock

> *(Skip if you already own the stock)*  
- Pick stocks you are comfortable owning long term
- Stable, low-beta stocks preferred
- Avoid earnings or high-volatility events near expiry

---

## 🎯 Choosing Strike Prices for Selling Covered Calls

### ✅ If you’re okay letting go of your stock:
- Choose **Delta ~ 0.3 – 0.4**
- Pick an **OTM option** with a chance to go ITM  
  → **Benefit**: premium + potential capital gains

### ✅ If you want to keep your stock:
- Choose **Delta close to 0**
- Pick a **deep OTM option**  
  → Lower premium, but higher chance of keeping shares

---

## 🗓️ Choosing Expiry Dates

- Sell options **30–45 days out**
  - Time decay (Theta) accelerates within final 30 days
- Watch out for:
  - **Earnings**
  - **Political events**
  - **Unexpected volatility spikes**

## 🚪 Exit Strategy for Covered Calls

### 📏 Rules of Thumb

1. **The 1% Rule**  
   - If **extrinsic value < 1%** of underlying price → Roll the call
2. **The 2 & 20 Rule**  
   - If within 2 weeks, the option loses **> 80% value** → Buy back, lock in profit
3. **Code Red Rule**  
   - If the stock crashes unexpectedly → Sell stock and exit all positions

### 🔄 By Scenario

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 📈 **Stock Goes Up** | Buy back call if you don’t want it called away |
| 📉 **Stock Drops** | Buy back for a gain, re-sell a lower strike safer call |
| ➖ **Stock Stays Flat** | Time decay works for you, roll out or resell at lower strike |

## 💡 The Poor Man’s Covered Call (PMCC)

> **Also known as: Long Diagonal Spread with Calls**

### 🧱 Structure

- Buy a **long-dated ITM call (LEAP)**
  - Expiry > 1 year
  - Delta ≥ 0.75 (acts like a stock)
- Sell a **short-dated OTM call**
  - Similar to covered call premium collection
  - Be careful: If it moves ITM, close the position

### 🔁 Diagonal = Mix of:
- **Vertical** (same expiry, different strikes)
- **Horizontal** (same strike, different expiry)

---

## 📘 LEAP (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities)

- Options with **> 1 year expiration**
- Behaves like synthetic long stock (with less capital)
- Strong **time value protection**
- Look for **Delta ≥ 0.75**

---

## 📌 Extra Rules of Thumb

- Short-term volatility can create buying opportunities for option sellers
- Avoid selling too close to IV spikes (e.g. earnings, Fed meetings)
